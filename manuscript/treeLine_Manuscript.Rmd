# Introduction

#### introduce the alpine-ecotone as a climatically sensitive ecosystem that may be vulnerable to climate change.
This ecosystem is associated with a range of socioeconomic values including recreation, tourism.
Ecologically, alpine-treeline ecotones are also found in environments that provide important habitat for species at risk such as whitebark pine, mountain ecotypes of woodland Caribou, and grizzly bears.  
Snowmelt from these sites provides important water downhill.
Thus, we need a greater understanding of potential impacts from climate change in these environments.

#### Introduce the alpine-treeline ecotone
At upper elevations, forests change to non-treed ecosystems, such as alpine tundra.  
How is this transition defined?
The boundary between forest and alpine ecosystems can be 'fuzzy' and difficult to discern [@Harsch2011a; @Feuillet2019a].  
A number of tree-based thresholds have been proposed including mean tree heights of and 
In British Columbia, a percentage cover by trees of 10% has been proposed [@MacKenzie2012].
The alpine-treeline boundary can also take a number of forms [@Harsch2011a].  
Diffuse treelines are characterized by a relative gradual decrease in tree height and density, primarily found in environments where summer climate limits growth but not regeneration.   

#### How does climate limit the position of the treeline?
Summer temperatures were once thought to limit the global alpine treeline
treeline position can be controlled through climatic effects on growth and regeneration.  Where cold temperatures or a short growing season prevent sufficient growth, trees may not accumulate sufficient carbon to achieve heights or sexual maturity.  Where this is the primary climatic limitation on growth, the treeline tends to appear diffuse, characterized by a relative gradual decrease in tree height and density [@Harsch2011a]
In other environments, Winter conditions can repeatedly damage trees through severe winds, snow and ice damage, thus limiting the survival of trees.  IN these environments, trees at the treeline may take on a multi-stemmed, prostate form, known as krummholz treeline [@Harsch2011a].  
There are non-climatic controls on the treeline position as well. Abrupt and island treelines may form in areas where treeline expansion is limited by permanent topographical features such as rock outcrops and thin soils, or by localized areas characterized by deep accumulations of snow that persist into the summer and preclude germination.  As well, successful seed germination and survival may be hindered by herbivory and competition from shrubs [@].  In other cases, dense shrub layers can prevent seedfall from reaching the ground [@]

#### Implications of climate on change alpine-treeline ecotone
An increase in tree establishment at the alpine-treeline ecotone can result in a range of phenomena that include; forest densification, increased growth, upward migration of the treeline [@Feuillet2019a], changes to forest species composition; and changes in tree morphology [@Camarera2017b].
About half of the world's treelines have migrated upwards in elevation, presumably associated with warmer temperatures [@Harsch2009]  

Treelines are relatively static and will lag behind climate change for a period of time. As well, the pathway of treeline migration will likely not be linear; rather trees may not rise until a climatic threshold has been exceeded that now allows for tree recruitment.  This will also vary depending on the climatic limitation.  Diffuse treelines may respond relatively quickly in response to warmer summer temperatures, wherewas krummholz treelines might not move until extreme and anomalous conditions lessen.  One severe winter storm can remove growth and form gains from previous decades.


Growth on the other hand, tends to respond at annual and finer temporal scales; therefore, the impacts of climate change in treeline forest may be observed initially in growth responses.
Treeline forests in Europe may reach size and reproductive potential similar to forests in subalpine forests by the middle of the 21st century, with treeline densification accelerating after that [@Camarero2017b].


#### Context for this study
The objectives of this study are to examine diffuse and krummholz treelines in three mountain ranges of central British Columbia, in order to determine historical chnages in treeline position and densification.  We studied this phenomenon at decadal scales through air-photo image analysis, as well as at inter-annual scales through dendrochronological data and satellite imagery.  Our main hypotheses were:
1. In central BC, trees in diffuse treelines are increasing raidal growth in response to warmer trends in the region; 
2. Forests near treeline increased in density over the past century;
3. Treelines are moving up in elevation
